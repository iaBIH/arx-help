    <h4>2.4. Risk analysis perspective</h4>
    <p>In this perspective, various metrics reflecting privacy risks are presented. Metrics implemented by ARX include 
       re-identification risks for the prosecutor, journalist and marketer attacks as well as estimates of population uniqueness, 
       which can be calculated using different statistical models. Moreover, the perspective also provides access to 
       a method for detecting 
       attributes which must be modified according to the <a href ="https://healthitsecurity.com/features/de-identification-of-phi-according-to-the-hipaa-privacy-rule" target="myPage"> Safe Harbor method </a> of the 
       US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (<a href ="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html" target="myPage">HIPAA</a> identifiers) and a method for detecting further quasi-identifiers.</p>
